# Project Backend

This is the backend repository for the project.

## Getting Started

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
pnpm run start:dev
```

> **Note:** Make sure the server runs on port `3000` so the frontend works properly.

This will start the documentation site on a local development server.
