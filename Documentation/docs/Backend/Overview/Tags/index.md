# Tags Module Overview

The **Tags module** is responsible for managing tags that categorize and organize contacts within the system. It supports both **system-defined tags** and **user-created custom tags**.

## Purpose

- **Categorization:** Helps users classify contacts for easy filtering, searching, and organization.
- **Consistency:** Provides predefined system tags for common categories such as Family, Friends, Work, Clients, and Emergency contacts.
- **Customization:** Allows users to create their own tags with custom names, colors, and descriptions to suit their personal or business needs.
- **Module Association:** Tags are associated with specific modules (e.g., `contacts`) to maintain contextual relevance.

## Key Features

- Predefined **system tags** that cannot be modified by users.
- Support for **custom user tags**.
- Optional **color coding** for visual identification.
- Timestamp tracking (`created_at` and `updated_at`) for auditing and history.
- Integration with the **Contacts module** for structured organization.

## Summary

**Purpose in short:**  
The Tags module enhances contact management by providing structured, flexible, and visually distinguishable categories, making it easier for users to organize and retrieve their contacts efficiently.
